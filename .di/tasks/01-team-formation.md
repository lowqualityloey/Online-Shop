You will be working as part of a team for the rest of the week. It's important to discuss and agree on how you will work together. Part of this team formation exercise will include applying knowledge from the Treaty of Waitangi.

The [Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi – ngā mātāpono o te tiriti](https://teara.govt.nz/en/principles-of-the-treaty-of-waitangi-nga-matapono-o-te-tiriti) should be applied to how your team works together for this project.

### Participation

Acknowledges sovereignty/governance. Ensure there is equal participation for each member of your team. Ensure everyone has input into decisions that directly affect them. Decide how you will ensure that each team member has equal participation. For example, a working agreement that ensures all code is reviewed by all team members before being merged.

### Protection

Acknowledges the protection of rights, benefits and, possessions. Each of your team members should have their Tikanga (culture and protocols) and Taonga (treasures) such as Te Reo Māori respected and given equal footing to the Tikanga and Taonga of other cultures. For example, you might run a morning prayer or Karakia, a standup, or other Tikanga.

### Partnership

Acknowledges sovereignty/governance and working together with the same rights and benefits as subjects of the Crown. This can be applied to your team by working together in partnership. Each team member should have a say in how the team performs. If you are making a decision that affects other people, they should have a say in the decision. For example, you might have a daily planning meeting where you divide up the work, ensuring that each team member has input into the tasks they will be working on.

Run the following workshop to decide on your team working agreements:

## Team Formation Workshop

This workshop is intended to collectively articulate the kind of behaviour that your team can expect from each other. You will be establishing your own team culture that will sit within the larger cohort. Jump on a video call or meet in person, and spend half an hour or so working through the following workshop

### Brainstorm (10mins)

Answer the following question: "What are the rules that we want the whole to abide by? And do you as an individual prefer to work a certain way?". Don't forget to apply the principals above.

Each team member should write down their responses on a sticky note or paper. You can write down multiple responses. You might want to use an online tool such as Google Docs or Miro to collaborate on this part.

Responses might be along the lines of "Be on time", "Listen to each other"

### Group similar ideas

Once you have completed your responses, group similar responses together

### Talk amongst yourselves (10mins)

Look at the groupings to see where there's already a broad agreement, quickly confirm these points. Now discuss where there are contentious or confusing (or contradictory) ideas. Don't gloss over this part. Embrace friction and a bit of healthy debate.

### Bring it to life (5mins)

Spend the final 5 mins of the workshop to discuss how you'll bring this to life. What actions will this take in reality? How will you accommodate the different workstyle preferences you've just uncovered? Do you have to re-schedule the daily stand-up to a more suitable time? etc.

### Document the outcome

Write your agreed actions down in `WORKING_AGREEMENTS.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

`WORKING_AGREEMENTS.md` file exists in the project, and includes the following:

- List of at least 5 actions
- Actions reflect the principals from the Treaty of Waitangi, such as partnership, participation, and protection
