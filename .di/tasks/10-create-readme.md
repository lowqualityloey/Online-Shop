# Create a README

All the projects you work on should have some form of documentation. This helps your team understand what the application is, how it works, and how they can contribute.

Replace the existing `README.md` file with your own documentation.

Write Markdown to format your text nicely. Read [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to see how you can markup your plain text using the markdown syntax.

Ensure your Readme covers all the items in the acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance criteria
