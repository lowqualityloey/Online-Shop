# Group planning

## Understanding the project

As a group, read through each of the GitHub issues in the backlog. For every ticket, each person in the group should acknowledge they understand what is being asked of them. It is the team's responsibility to ensure each person understands every ticket.

Feel free to pull in an instructor if the requirements are not clear. It's vital that you understand what is being asked of you.

In particular, identify if any tickets depend on each other. For example, you need to create a Stripe account before you can add products to the Stripe account.

## Assinging issues

### How to assign group issues

Now you know what the project is, and what items you will be selling, it's time to get started.

The backlog is in priority order. You should complete the issues at the top of the column before starting any more issues. Never start a new issue before completing the previous issue. That means you should **never** have more than one issue assigned to you.

When you work as a team, only assign enough issues so that each team member has something to work on. Don't assign all the issues upfront. When you complete an issue, you can come to the backlog and pick up the next issue.

For issues that have the `group` label, you can choose to assign issues as individuals, in smaller groups or as the entire group. For example, it's ok if the entire group works on each ticket one at a time together.

In summary:

- You should only ever be assigned to one issue at a time
- Finish an issue before starting a new issue
- Start with the issues at the top of the column first. Do not re-prioritise them.
- You can split up the `group` issues however you want

### How to assign individual issues

There are three issues with the label `individual`. These issues are to be completed individually. Each team member should have one of these issues assigned to them.

If your team only has two members, then just choose one of the issues each. You can leave the third one not implemented, or come back to it after all the other issues are completed.

As a group, decide who will work on what issue.

### Assign the issues

- As a team, decide if you are going to work together or individually on `group` issues.
- For each team member, assign them to a `group` issue, and drag it into the* In Progress* column. Stop when each team member has an issue that they are working on.
- Assign a team member to each of the individual issues. These do not need to be dragged to _In Progress_ until all the issues above are completed

## Acceptance criteria

- The Team has agreed on what products the shop will sell
- Each person in the team has one of the individual issues assigned to them
- Each team member has only one issue _In Progress_
- None of the `individual` issues are _In Progress_
