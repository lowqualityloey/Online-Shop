# Demo

Prepare a demonstration of the application you have just built.

This is a common formality in product teams, where they will demo their working software to the Product Manager in order to get feedback.

This will be the intended audience of your demo. There is no need to get into how the code works, focus more on how it works from a customer perspective. Customers in this case include people who create the products in Stripe, as well as customers who buy things from the shop.

Create a Loom account, and record a demo of your app using Loom.

Normally you would demo to an audience, so for this demo you will be posting the final video into the #events channel in Slack. This way other students and instructors can view your work.
