# Decide what you will sell

As a group, run a brainstorm session on what you will sell. Run a meeting in the following format:

Nominate one person to facilitate the session. They should create a Miro Board and share the link to the team before the meeting

## Brainstorm ideas (5 mins)

The facilitator should set a 5-minute timer, and instruct the team to start adding their ideas to the Miro board as post-its.

There is no limit to the number of ideas you can add.

## Vote (2 mins)

Each person gets 2 votes each. To vote, add a thumbs-up emoji to the post-it you want to vote for. You are allowed to use both of your votes on one idea.

## Choose an idea

The idea with the highest vote wins. If two ideas are equal, have a conversation as a team to decide on which one you will choose.

## Document the outcome

Leave a comment on this GitHub issue with screenshots of your Miro board, and the chosen idea.

## Acceptance criteria

- The Team has agreed on what products the shop will sell
- The GitHub issue includes screenshots of the brainstorm session
